## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive statistical validation of the Geometrodynamics of Entropy (GoE) framework's fermion mass quantization model. The analysis employs multiple complementary statistical methods to assess robustness, convergence, and structural significance. The primary validation suite consists of Monte Carlo simulations (1,000,000 samples), permutation testing (500,000 samples), and bootstrap resampling (100,000 samples), complemented by effect size metrics and distributional analysis.

**Key Finding:** The statistical evidence indicates that the observed φ-scaling structure is unlikely to arise from random chance or structural artifacts, with permutation test p-value p = 0.004476 and median ratio of 3.47 × 10⁵ between permuted and original distributions.

## 1. Most Representative Study: Comprehensive Validation Suite

### 1.1 Overview

The most comprehensive validation study combines three independent statistical tests:

- **Monte Carlo φ-uncertainty analysis:** 1,000,000 samples
- **Permutation test:** 500,000 samples  
- **Bootstrap resampling:** 100,000 samples
- **Effect size metrics:** Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U test, Cohen's d
- **Distributional analysis:** ECDF comparison

This combination provides complementary perspectives on model robustness, addressing different classes of potential artifacts and systematic errors.

### 1.2 Statistical Convergence

With 1,000,000 Monte Carlo samples, the Monte Carlo error scales as:

σ_MC ~ 1/√N ≈ 1/√10⁶ ≈ 0.001

**Results:**
- Monte Carlo median MAPE: 7.275%
- 95th percentile MAPE: 15.85%
- Mean: 8.671% ± 3.394%

These statistics demonstrate convergence, as evidenced by their stability across different sample sizes (100k and 1M samples show consistent median values).

**Convergence Assessment:** The statistical convergence is visible in the stability of percentiles across sample sizes. The median value remains stable (approximately 7.27-7.28%) when comparing 100k and 1M sample runs, indicating sufficient sampling for robust inference.

### 1.3 Permutation Test: Structural Significance

**Method:** The permutation test addresses the null hypothesis that the observed φ-scaling structure could arise from random assignment of quantum numbers n to fermion masses. For each permutation, the quantum number assignments are randomly shuffled while maintaining the mass hierarchy.

**Results:**
- Original MAPE: 6.914%
- Permuted MAPE median: 2,400,797%
- Permuted MAPE 95th percentile: 2.17 × 10⁸%
- p-value: 0.004476
- Median ratio: 3.47 × 10⁵
- P95 ratio: 3.13 × 10⁷

**Interpretation:** The permutation test provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the observed structure is due to chance. The p-value of 0.004476 indicates that fewer than 0.5% of random permutations produce MAPE values as low as the original structure. The median ratio of 3.47 × 10⁵ indicates that permuting the structure increases the error by approximately 347,000-fold on average.

**Epistemic Value:** This test directly addresses concerns about "numerical pareidolia" or spurious structure detection. The extreme separation between permuted and original distributions demonstrates that the observed φ-scaling is not an artifact of random number assignment.

### 1.4 Bootstrap Resampling: Estimation Robustness

**Method:** Bootstrap resampling with replacement measures the stability of the median MAPE estimate under resampling from the Monte Carlo distribution.

**Results:**
- Bootstrap samples: 100,000
- Median MAPE: 7.275% ± 0.0047%
- 95% confidence interval for median: [7.266%, 7.285%]
- 95% confidence interval for P95: [15.824%, 15.876%]

**Interpretation:** The extremely narrow 95% confidence interval (width ≈ 0.019%) indicates that the median MAPE estimate is highly stable. The low variance (σ = 0.0047%) demonstrates that the model is locked into a stable minimum, with minimal estimation uncertainty.

**Epistemic Value:** This addresses concerns about parameter overfitting or unstable optimization. The bootstrap CI demonstrates that the observed performance is not due to favorable resampling but represents a robust property of the model structure.

### 1.5 Effect Size Metrics

**Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:**
- KS statistic: 0.995524
- KS p-value: 0.008952

**Mann-Whitney U Test:**
- U statistic: 1119.0
- p-value: 0.042326

**Cohen's d:**
- d = -1.014
- Interpretation: Large effect size (|d| > 0.8)

**Common Language Effect Size (CLES):**
- CLES = 0.002238

**Interpretation:** All effect size metrics indicate substantial separation between the original and permuted distributions. The KS statistic near 1.0 indicates near-complete distributional separation. Cohen's d of -1.014 indicates a large effect size by conventional standards (Cohen, 1988). The CLES value of 0.002 indicates that only 0.2% of permuted samples achieve MAPE values lower than the original.

**Epistemic Value:** These metrics quantify the magnitude of the structural effect, complementing the statistical significance tests. The consistent "large effect" designation across multiple metrics provides robust evidence for the strength of the observed structure.

## 2. Second Most Representative Study: Reduced Resolution Validation

### 2.1 Overview

A complementary validation study with reduced sample sizes:

- **Monte Carlo:** 100,000 samples
- **Permutation:** 50,000 samples
- **Analysis:** Histograms and ECDF plots

### 2.2 Rationale

This study serves as an independent replication with lower resolution. The consistency of results across different sample sizes strengthens the evidence that the observed effects are not artifacts of large-sample statistics or computational artifacts.

**Results Consistency:** The key statistics (median MAPE ≈ 7.27%, permutation p-value < 0.01) reproduce across different sample sizes, demonstrating robustness to sample size variations.

**Epistemic Value:** This addresses potential concerns about large-sample artifacts. The replication at lower sample sizes demonstrates that the observed effects are not dependent on extreme sample sizes and represent genuine structural properties.

## 3. Supporting Studies: Supplementary Material

### 3.1 Lower Resolution Studies

Studies with fewer samples (e.g., < 10,000 Monte Carlo samples, < 5,000 permutations) show consistent trends but lack statistical power for definitive conclusions. These studies demonstrate qualitative consistency but should be relegated to supplementary material rather than the main paper.

**Recommendation:** Include in supplementary information as exploratory analysis, but do not rely on these for primary claims.

### 3.2 Telemetry and Diagnostic Plots

Short telemetry runs and diagnostic visualizations provide useful exploration but do not constitute independent validation. These materials support narrative but should not be used for statistical claims.

2. **"Parameter overfitting":** Addressed by bootstrap CI (extremely narrow intervals) and Monte Carlo stability
3. **"Model cherry picking":** Addressed by effect size metrics demonstrating large, consistent effects across multiple statistics

## 9. Conclusion

The comprehensive statistical validation suite provides robust evidence for the structural significance of the φ-scaling relationship in fermion mass quantization. The combination of Monte Carlo analysis, permutation testing, bootstrap resampling, and effect size metrics addresses multiple epistemic concerns and provides complementary evidence.

**Primary findings:**
1. The model demonstrates robustness to φ-uncertainty (Monte Carlo median stable at 7.275%)
2. The observed structure is statistically significant (permutation p = 0.004476)
3. The estimate is highly stable (bootstrap CI95 width = 0.019%)
4. The effect size is large (Cohen's d = -1.014, KS ≈ 1.0)

**The structure persists under:**
- Noise (Monte Carlo φ-uncertainty)
- Resampling (bootstrap)
- Structural scrambling (permutation)
- φ variability (Monte Carlo)

**Recommendation:** The comprehensive validation suite (1M Monte Carlo + 500k permutation + 100k bootstrap) represents the strongest evidence and should form the core of the statistical validation section in the main paper. Supporting studies with lower sample sizes should be included in supplementary material as consistency checks.
